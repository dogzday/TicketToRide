## TicketToRide
This is the **nonprofit purely academic** console/textual version of the game [Ticket To Ride](https://www.daysofwonder.com/tickettoride/en/usa/ "Ticket To Ride") by [Days of Wonder](https://www.daysofwonder.com/en/ "Days of Wonder"). Our aim is to represent it as closely as possible. **No copyright infringement intended**. Game written from the ground-up.

## Motivation
Our team wants to get familiar with Github with a small project to understand workflow.

## Code style
Any - **be readable**. For classes **other than** `model.ControllerModel.java` or `view.ControllerView.java`, please follow code style for consistency.

## Built With
**IDE**

- [IntelliJ Idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)

**Tech**

- [JavaFX](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/toc.htm "JavaFX")

## Features
N/A

## Example
Mostly all methods exist for standard gameplay purposes already. **Do not** modify classes other than `model.ControllerModel.java` or `view.ControllerView.java` unless adding features. In that case, follow the code style for those classes.

`ControllerModel.java` handles game flow.

`Cards.java` contains the decks as a `java.util.List` of class `DestinationCard` and enum `TrainCardOrRouteColor`.

`DestinationCard.java` contains information about a single destination card - source, destination, and score.

`Cities.java` contains the list of all cities in the game.

`Graph.java` is a basic graph which contains a `java.util.LinkedList` of `Edge.java`.

`Edge.java` is the route from a `Cities` to another `Cities`.

`Player.java` contains all data for a player. Update each player data accordingly to gameplay.

`TeamColor.java` contains the list of all possible team colors - 5 in the base game. More could be added for complicated gameplay for example.

`TrainCardOrRouteColor.java` contains the list of all possible train cards/route colors, since they mutually correspond.
